Join Michele, Heath and Nicole and be transported to a world of untouched splendor, a melting pot of cultural heritage and an opportunity to be spoiled silly with an immersion into wellness, experiencing the healthy food, ancient therapies and nature of Bulgaria.



All spring long, you’ve been planting seeds, starting projects, and embarking on new beginnings. Our ancestors spent the entirety of spring cultivating the land and restocking themselves with food, etc.. By the time the summer solstice took place (which we will be approaching), they were finally able to take a rest and relish a period of comfortable ease. Midsummer is an ideal time to fully embrace everything that you love about life.



On this retreat, we will be finding our own unique way to observe this time of the year,

Some more details about where we are headed:



Bulgaria is an ancient Balkan nation, with a diverse natural landscape, ranging from breath-taking mountains to lowland plains and river valleys, including the famous Danube and home to almost 200 miles of magnificent Black Sea coastline, the Bulgarian Riviera is lined with beautiful golden beaches and this peaceful sea.



With a clean fresh water surface, swimming in the Black Sea is possible; though offer a different experience from other water bodies. With its strange features, including the high level of minerals and salt, normally the objects tend to float on the water. Get ready to float!!



A cultural melting pot with Greek, Slavic, Ottoman, and Persian influences, it has a rich heritage of traditional dance, music, costumes, and crafts. At the foot of domed Vitosha mountain is its capital city, Sofia, dating to the 5th century B.C.

It’s history is so dynamic and rooted at its core in democracy, fairness and justice – a small country with a big story.



Bulgaria is internationally known are yogurt and white brine (feta) cheese. Fresh delicious food, locally grown is commonplace everywhere we travel.



The Rose is the symbol of Bulgaria. Rose picking, one of the oldest and traditional customs of Bulgarians. Carpets from the time of the Bulgarian Revival are now highly valued works of art. Along with traditional handicrafts, Bulgaria’s people have also preserved a wide range of traditional popular customs and songs as folk music and dance are a staple in their culture.



During the Bulgarian Revival, the monasteries served as centers of artistic and educational activity. There are still many working monasteries in the country that we will be visiting!



Get ready to be pleasantly surprised!
